## 📦 Dependency Awareness & Context7 MCP Integration

Use **Context7 MCP** before starting any task involving:

- Libraries, CLI commands, config files, or package dependencies  
- React/Next.js hooks, middleware, build tools (e.g., Webpack, TurboPack)  
- Docker, CI/CD pipelines, authentication flows, or database connections  

### 🛠 MCP Responsibilities:

- Fetch **latest official documentation** and changelogs  
- Identify **breaking changes, deprecations, and best practices**  
- Validate code with **latest stable versions** of packages  
- Suggest better alternatives if packages are outdated or unmaintained  

**Sources:**  
- Official docs  
- GitHub release pages  
- npmjs, Vercel, MongoDB, MDN, etc.

## 🗃️ Project Awareness & File Protocol

### 📂 Read These at the Start of Each Task:
- `PLANNING.md` — Architecture, naming, styles, constraints  
- `TASK.md` — Current and completed tasks  
- `env-schema.txt` — All required `.env` variables  

### 🧩 Task Management:
- If a task isn’t in `TASK.md`, **add it with today’s date**  
- Use a **"Discovered During Work"** section for found bugs, TODOs, or new ideas  

### 🐞 After Debugging:
- Update `DEBUG.md`  
  - What was debugged  
  - Which logs or temp code were added  
  - What’s safe to delete later  

---

## 📁 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Max 500 lines per file** — split into helpers or modules  
- **Use relative imports** within features or packages  
- **Group code by responsibility** (e.g., auth, dashboard, payments)  
- When redesigning existing components (e.g. Hero), **refactor instead of creating new files**

---

## ✅ Task Execution Checklist

- Use **Next.js optimizations** (SSR, ISR, caching, lazy loading, code-splitting)  
- Apply **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions**  
- Optimize for performance and scalability  
- Ensure **clean, readable, and modular code**

### ✅ After Finishing a Task:
- Mark it in `TASK.md`  
- Ensure app builds and runs without issues  
- Update `README.md` if setup, logic, or dependency changed  
- Add inline `# Reason:` comments for complex logic  
- Comment all non-obvious implementation decisions

---

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- Use **Pytest** for unit tests  
- Tests go inside `/tests` directory, mirroring app structure  
- Include at least:
  - 1 expected use case  
  - 1 edge case  
  - 1 failure case  
- Update tests when logic changes

---

## 🚫 DO NOT:

- Guess missing context — **ask questions**  
- Hallucinate functions or features — **verify with MCP**  
- Reference non-existent file paths or modules  
- Delete or overwrite existing code unless told to  
- Create duplicate files for UI components already existing  
- Skip `README.md`, `TASK.md`, or `DEBUG.md` updates
